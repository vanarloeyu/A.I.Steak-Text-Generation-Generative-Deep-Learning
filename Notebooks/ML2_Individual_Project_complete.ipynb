    "With the global food industry expected to reach USD 12.24 trillion [1] and mobile sales to reach 2.05 billion units [2] in 2020, there is a big business opportunity to innovate on new ways to capitalize on this expanding market. Through a USD 1 app that generates recipes using artificial intelligence with almost zero operating cost, we can get a revenue of USD 200 million by just getting a 10\\% share of the new mobile devices. In this notebook, I demonstrated how to generate steak recipes using generative deep learning using textgenrnn which is a recurrent neural network model. I trained model using 444 steak recipes gathered online. Through sensitivity analysis, I was able to arrive at a model that has a cross entropy loss of 0.422 compared to the default baseline of 0.590. Additionaly, through sensitivity analysis, I was able to select 0.5 as the best temperature parameter to obtain realistic steak recipes."

    "\"char-rnn\" stands for for “character recurrent neural network”. It is a recurrent neural network that predicts the next character given a sequence of characters. It implements multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) for training/sampling from character-level language models. Since it is a recurrent neural network, the predicted output becomes the input for the next iteration and so on. This can be visualized by looking at the example below wherein the whole phrase is \"Hello darkness my old friend\". Frome here we see from the first row that y is the predicted character. In the succeeding row, the y becomes one of the input after the window is moved by one character. [5]\n",

    "The pretrained-model follows a neural network architecture inspired by DeepMoji as described the the creator. The model takes an input of 40 characters by defaults, but can be tuned in the parameters. Each character is converted to a 100-D character embedding vector, a technique to conserve the meaning and context. It is then fed into a 128-cell long-short-term-memory (LSTM) recurrent layer and then the output is inputed into another 128-cell long-short-term-memory (LSTM) recurrent layer. The three layers are then fed into an Attention layer that was taken from DeepMoji to weigh the most important temporal features and average them together. The skip connection going into the attention layer was design to backpropagate easily and avoid vanishing gradients. Finally the output is mapped to the probabilities of 394 unique characters. These 394 characters include uppercase characters, lowercase, punctuation, and emoji. [3]\n",

First, I trained a model using a bidirectional LSTM that considers the sequence in both backward and forward directions. Second, I trained a model with an additional dropout layer of 10%. This would help make the model more robust. Third, I trained a model that learns at a word level instead of a character level. "

    "We see that for temperature 0.2, there are a lot of repeating ingredients. There is no drastic mistake on how it defines the recipe, but it is too safe in predicting the next ingredient by just sticking to common ingredients like salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that for temperature 1.0, there are less repeating ingredients. The model looks like it is more creative in its output by not being trapped to just common ingredients. However, we can see that there are typographical-error-like mistakes in spelling. This is because a temperature of 1.0 is best for well trained models that have been trained to thousands of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when we look at the default temperature of 0.5, we are able to achieve a balance between creativity and conservativeness. Looking at the output, we have less repeating ingredients and more creative predictions. We also minimize the errors in spelling."

    "In this notebook, I demonstrated how to generate steak recipes using generative deep learning using textgenrnn which is a recurrent neural network model. I trained model using 444 steak recipes gathered online. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through sensitivity analysis, I was able to arrive at a model that has a loss of 0.422 compared to the default baseline of 0.590. The final model selected uses a bidirectional LSTM compared to the default regualr LSTM model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly, through sensitivity analysis, I was able to select 0.5 as the best temperature parameter to obtain realistic steak recipes. This temperature achieves a balance between creativity and conservativeness. It generates recipes that are unique with minimal repeating ingredients and minimal spelling errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our results we can see that the generated text would not be of high quality 100% of the time. According to the creator, this is why in practice the generated text is usually filtered, curated, and edited before publishing afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say that the results vary greatly between datasets. The patters between different corpus would vary greatly, and the application of the model to different data would not be the same. If the dataset is small, thus more training is required. Currently there is no rule or establish heuristics on training to achieve the best results. However, the creator recommends least 2,000-5,000 documents to train a good model, where in our application we were only able to use 444 recipes or documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In extending the study, the contextual mode can be used to develop more recipes that can be based on types of meat or cuisine. More and more products today target niche markets. With the contextual mode, we can train focused on a certain niche that can be marketed to target audience."
