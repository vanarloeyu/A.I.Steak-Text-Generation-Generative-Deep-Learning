# Steak A.I.: Text Generation of Steak Recipes Using Generative Deep Learning

Author: Van Arloe M. Yu

## Abstract
With the global food industry expected to reach USD 12.24 trillion [1] and mobile sales to reach 2.05 billion units [2] in 2020, there is a big business opportunity to innovate on new ways to capitalize on this expanding market. Through a USD 1 app that generates recipes using artificial intelligence with almost zero operating cost, we can get a revenue of USD 200 million by just getting a 10% share of the new mobile devices. In this notebook, I demonstrated how to generate steak recipes using generative deep learning using textgenrnn which is a recurrent neural network model. I trained model using 444 steak recipes gathered online. Through sensitivity analysis, I was able to arrive at a model that has a cross entropy loss of 0.422 compared to the default baseline of 0.590. Additionaly, through sensitivity analysis, I was able to select 0.5 as the best temperature parameter to obtain realistic steak recipes.
