Ariel's Peppercorn Steak (Or Steak Au Poivre)

main dish, meats

1 single 8 to 12 oz new york sirloin
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 coarsely crushed peppercorns
1 red wine
1  cream
1  cognac

1) Combine olive oil, teriyaki and worcestershire sauces to form a
marinade
for the meat. Or, you may use a marinade recipe of your choice.
Marinade
the steak at least a few hours, or overnight in the fridge turning
the
meat occasionally. 2) Crush enough peppercorns to cover the steak
on both sides. Put the
crushed peppercorns on a cutting board and press the steak onto the
peppercorns to coat. Do the same for both sides of the steak. 3)
Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron with grill lines) and plop
the
steak into it. Depending on the meat and the marinade, you may
have to add
a bit of oil. 4) Cook both sides evenly until the meat is medium
rare, or to your
liking. 5) Put the meat on a heated plate. Keep the liquid in the
skillet and add
some wine to deglaze the skillet. (ie collect all the remains into
a
sauce). Cook (fairly high heat) until the sauce thickens, stirring
occasionally. 6) For more sauce, or Steak au Poivre la Creme, add
cream and cook a
little longer. Usually you need to do this to thicken the sauce.
7) Add cognac, cook some more. Sauce should always be thick. Pour
sauce over
steak and optionally flambe in cognac (Steak au Poivre Flambe).
Serve with Parisienne potatoes and carrots.

Baked Flank Steak (Lf)

beef

1 1/2 lb flank steak
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup hot water
1 bay leaf
1 large garlic clove -- crushed
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon celery -- minced
1/8 teaspoon black pepper -- fresh
1  ground
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 medium carrot -- diced
1/4 medium bell pepper -- diced

Trim away any visible fat from the steak.  Sear the steak in the oil
over medium to med-high heat.  Place the steak in a casserole dish.
For extra flavoring, pour the water into the skillet you seared the
meat in, and stir.  Pour this over the meat, then add all the other
ingredients. Cook uncovered at 350F for 30 minutes, or longer if you
prefer your meat well done. Makes 4 servings, 4.5 oz each, plus
sauce, but without optional gravy. LIGHT GRAVY: (Optional) Heat 1
Tablespoon of vegetable oil, and stir in 2 Tablespoons of whole-wheat
flour. Take a cup of liquid from the meat and stir into the roux.
Stir until thickened, and serve over the meat. Using the Gravy adds
30 calories and 3 grams of fat; nutrient values of the meat liquid
and other ingredients are included in the original analysis.

Combine all the basting sauce ingredients and soak the caribou slices in
the sauce for at least 24 hours. Pour off and reserve the sauce. Put the
meat on a board and pat it dry, then nick the edges of the slices and rub
them all over with the fat.

Heat the grill to medium-high and grill the steaks until medium-rare. Baste
the meat with the reserved basting sauce while cooking and turn it once.
When done, transfer the slices to a warmed serving platter, and serve at
once, with the remaining sauce in a sauce boat.

Chicken Fried Steak ( Kathy Pitts )

beef, steak, thrift

1 text only

Begin with a good-sized hunk of round steak, the steak should be at
least 1/2 inch thick.  Cut the steak into serving-sized pieces.

Now the fun begins.  I use a method of tenderizing the meat passed on
to me by my father, who made great CFS -- first, score the exterior
of the meat with tiny, diamond-shaped patterns (like you'd use to
score the fat on a ham, but make the diamonds only about 1/4 inch
long.) Do this to both sides of the meat.  Then pound the heck out of
the meat using the heaviest implement you can find (a heavy saucer,
the handle of a BIG knife or -- my personal favorite -- a clean claw
hammer).

The meat should be pounded until it almost, but not quite, gives up
and falls to pieces.

Now mix up a quantity of seasoned flour (salt, pepper, maybe some
paprika and garlic powder).  Also beat a couple of whole eggs with a
couple of tablespoons of water.

Dip the pounded meat first in the flour, then in the egg, then back
in the flour.  For a really crisp crust, dip again in the egg, and
back in the flour (this is optional, but I almost always do it, to
me, the crust is the best part of the dish).  Allow the breaded meat
to sit for a few minutes to set up the breading.

Melt some oil, bacon grease or lard in a heavy frying pan. Use enough
to cover the pan to the depth of 1/4 inch.  When the fat is hot, but
not smoking, place some of the meat in the pan.  Do not overcrowd,
and do not allow the individual pieces of steak to touch.

Cook on one side until nicely browned, turn and cook the second side.
Remove the cooked steak to a warm place, and continue cooking the
remainder until all is done.  Add more fat to the pan as needed.

Add 2 Tbsp. of flour to every 2 Tbsp. of fat left in the pan (stir to
scrape up the little browned, crispy bits that are sticking to the
pan, too).  Cook this mixture briefly to get rid of the raw flour
taste, but do not allow it to brown.  Stir in milk (about 1 cup to
each 2 Tbsp. of flour) to make a gravy.  Season to taste with salt,
black pepper (lots of black pepper), and serve gravy of the meat and
the mashed potatoes you're going to serve on the side.

Chicken Fried Steak With Cream Gravy

none

1 round steak, cut about
1 inch thick (about 2 lbs)
2 large eggs
2 tablespoon milk
1/4 cup unbleached flour
1 salt and freshly ground
1  pepper, to taste
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 recipe cream gravy (see
1  below)

One of the old standbys, this was served in many of the roadside diners
that catered to truck drivers.  It soon became a favorite of just about
everybody.

Cut the steak crosswise into 4 serving pieces.  Place one piece between two
sheets of plastic wrap then using a rolling pin or meat pounder, pound to a
1/4-inch thickness.  Repeat with the remaining pieces. In a pie plate, beat
the milk and eggs together, in a second pie plate combine the flour and the
seasonings together.  Dip each piece of steak first into the egg mixture
then into the flour mixture, coating completely. Shake gently to remove the
excess flour mixture. Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet, using medium
heat, fry the steaks, two at a time, about 5 minutes on a side or until
golden brown on each side. Serve with biscuits and cream gravy. From: Dave

1 1/2 lb top round steak
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup beef broth

Crisp Beef In Chili Sauce

main dish, meats, steak, chinese

1 lb beef steak
      ----MARINADE----
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 teaspoon rice wine
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 cup peanut oil
      ----SAUCE----
1 1/2 tablespoon peanut oil
5  dried chiles; halved
3 tablespoon garlic, finely sliced
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon cornstarch; mixed with
1 teaspoon water

PLACE THE MEAT in the freezer for about 20 minutes, or until it is
firm to the touch. Cut it into slices against the grain, then finely
shred the slices. Combine the meat with the marinade and mix very
well. Soak the dried chiles in warm water. When they are soft and
pliable, cut them in half. Heat a wok or large skillet until it is
hot. Add the 2 cups of oil and when it is very hot and almost
smoking, deep-fry the beef in 2 batches. Remove with a slotted spoon
and drain the meat in a colander. Heat a small saucepan and when it
is hot, add the 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, garlic and chilies and
stir-fry for 20 seconds. Then add the rest of the sauce ingredients
and simmer for 2 minutes. Keep warm. Reheat the oil in the wok until
it is very hot. Deep-fry the beef again until it is very crisp, about
1 minute. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels
and place on a warm platter. Gently toss the beef with the sauce and
serve immediately. Serves 4 as part of a Chinese meal, or 2 as a
single dish.

Dick Sturza's Beefsteak Marinara

main dish, meats

2 lb top round beef,fat trimmed
2 tablespoon olive oil
1  large onion,chopped
2 teaspoon minced or pressed garlic
1/2 lb fresh mushrooms,thin sliced
1 tablespoon butter/margarine/olive oil
3 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 can condensed beef consomme
1/2 cup dry wine
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1 can stewed tomatoes (14.5 oz)
1  hot cooked spaghetti
1  salt
1  pepper

Dick Sturza was all set for a juicy beef Stroganoff; the beef was
cubed, the mushrooms were sliced, and all the other necessary
ingredients were at hand. Then tragedy struck. The sour cream had
gone over the hill, and there was no time to replace it. He
improvised brilliantly by creating this beefsteak marinara, a
casserole with satisfying complexity of flavor that can be started
well before the dinner hour and will require little attention before
serving time.

1. Cut meat into 3/4" cubes. Pour 1 tablespoon oil into a 10-12"
frying pan over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add meat, a
portion at a time, cooking until well browned; stir often. Transfer
meat with a slotted spoon to a shallow 3 to 3 1/2 quart casserole.
2. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the frying pan along with onion, garlic,
and mushrooms; stir often until onion is limp, about 10 minutes. With
a slotted spoon, transfer mixture to casserole. Melt butter in frying
pan, add flour, and stir until mixture bubbles. Smoothly blend in
consomme, wine, tomato paste, parsley, basil, oregano, and tomatoes
(break them up with a spoon) and liquid; stir until boiling.
3. Mix sauce with ingredients in casserole. Cover tightly with foil
and bake in a 350'F. oven until meat is very tender when pierced,
about 2 1/2 hours. Serve over hot cooked spaghetti and add salt and
pepper to taste. Makes 4-5 cups.

Double-Hot Chile Steaks

none

1/2 cup ground pure new mexico hot
1 red chile
2 cup canned whole tomatoes or 4
1 large red-ripe tomatoes,
1  peeled, quartered
1 cup parched, peeled, seeded,
1 chopped fresh new mexico hot
1 green chiles or 1 (7 oz.)
1 can diced green chiles
1 hot red onion, cut in cubes
4 large cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground oregano, pref.mexican
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
4 lb well-aged beef sirloin, cut
1  1 -1/2 to 2 inches thick

One of the heirs to a New Mexico mercantile fortune developed this
Albuquerque special.  These fiery-hot steaks sort of go with the territory
in New Mexico, they say you can tell the natives by how hot they can
handle their chiles!  Though it's virtually steaming, the steak sauce is a
super complement for the strong flavor of the beef.

In a blender or food processor, combine ground chile, tomatoes, chiles,
onion, garlic, salt, oregano and cumin.  Process until pureed.  If made
ahead, refrigerate until ready to use.  To prepare steak, let both steak
and sauce come to room temperature. Then place steak in a shallow dish,
coat generously on both sides with sauce and let stand 2 hours at room
temperature, spooning more sauce over steak occasionally.  Preheat broiler
or prepare a bed of hot coals.  Adjust oven rack so meat will be 4 to 6
inches below heat source; adjust barbecue grill 4 to 6 inches above coals.
Lightly grease rack in broiler pan or barbecue grill. Broil or grill steak
(with sauce that clings to it) to desired doneness, turning once; allow 10
to 15 minutes per side for medium rare.  Serve with additional sauce,
warmed over low heat.

Beth's Note: Amarillo is a town of about 175,000 people in the middle
of the panhandle of Texas. Visitors expect great steaks, ranch style
barbecue and red-hot Tex-Mex cooking along the Texas stretch of
Interstates 40 and 27. But Amanllo restaurants offer other treasures
as well, thanks to the influence of newer Texans from Indochina and
Asia. Cafes with names such as the Thai Star, My Thai, Peking and
Hunan have taught Texans that jalapenos are not the only way to turn
on your taste buds. --Food Editor, Amarillo Globe-News, Amarillo

celery, tomatoes, salt, pepper, sugar, bay leaves and thyme. Simmer 30
minutes. Add bell peppers; simmer 10 minutes.

SAGER To: ALL Subject: PIZZA Flags:

Hi, thought maybe someone out there would like either of my recipes.

Roast Beef Bar - B - Q  Pizza :

I always use Robin Hood pizza dough mix or you can use your regular dough
recipe for the crust.
You'll need 1# of Roast Beef, cut it into small pieces then pour 1 bottle
of B-B-Q sauce into the meat. After you have the meat well coated then
spread the mixture onto your pizza crust. You can use whatever cheese you
like the most, I always use Mozzarella on mine.

Pierogie Pizza:
1. Your favorite pizza crust
2. A mixture of mashed potatoes (I've always used homemade, never tried
powder yet)
3. Small can of sauerkraut
4. Mozzarella and cheddar cheese (I sometimes use 3 cups of cheese
depending on how much of the potato mix you put on your pizza.)

Use your mixer to mix the sauerkraut into the mashed potatoes.  Then
spread onto your crust and then add cheese.  You can put as much potatoe
mix as you want on the pizza just becareful when you cut it the potato mix
will be very hot!

I hope you enjoy them!!!

Flank Steak With Garlic Wine Sauce

none

1 1/2 lb flank steak (1 piece)
1 single salt & pepper, to taste
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
2 tablespoon thinly slice scallions
1 cup dry red wine
1 single garlic puree(1 head roasted)

Sprinkle flank steak with salt and a generous amount of freshly ground
black pepper.  Heat a wide heavy skillet.  Do not add fat.  When hot,
cook seasoned steak until seared and well browned on each side (about
1 minute per side).  Reduce heat and add 2 T butter.  Cook 3 to 5
minutes on each side.  For best results, the meat should be quite
rare.  Remove the meat from the pan and keep warm.  Pour off the fat
in the skillet and add the scallions and red wine.  Bring to a boil
and whisk in the garlic puree. Boil until the wine is reduced by
half, thickened, and syrupy.  As it boils, scrape up the browned bits
in the skillet with a wooden spoon. Stir in the meat juices that have
accumulated unter the flank steak.  Boil for 1 or 2 seconds more.
Remove from the heat.  Gently swirl in the 2 T soften butter so that
it incorporates into the wine.  Quickly slice the meat, against the
grain, into thin strips.  Arrange the slices on a hot platter, pour
sauce down the center of them and serve at once.

4  cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon oregano

Grilled Marinated Skirt Steak

main dish, meats

1/2 cup cumin seeds
4  jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
3  cloves garlic
4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup lime juice (from about 4 limes)
2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves an; d stems
1 cup olive oil
3 lb skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat; and cut into 6 pieces
1  avocado corn relish
12  flour tortillas, heated

1. In a small, heavy frying pan, toast the cumin seeds over
moderately high heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Transfer the cumin seeds to a blender.

2. Add the jalapenos, garlic, black pepper and salt to the blender and
puree with the lime juice until the cumin seeds are finely ground.
Then add the cilantro and oil and puree until smooth.

3. Rub the meat all over with some of the marinade and roll each
piece into a cylinder. Arrange the meat in a shallow glass dish or
stainless-steel pan. Pour the remaining marinade over the meat. Cover
and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. About 30 minutes
before cooking, remove the meat from the refrigerator and unroll each
steak.

4. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Grill or broil the steaks for
3 minutes. Turn the meat and cook to your taste, about 3 to 4 minutes
longer for medium-rare. Transfer to a carving board and let rest in a
warm spot for 5 minutes. Slice the steaks across the grain and on the
diagonal. The slices should be about 1/4 inch thick. Serve with the
Avocado Corn Relish and warm flour tortillas.

Look for a robust red wine that won't be overwhelmed by the strong
Southwestern flavors of this marinated steak with its spicy relish.
Try a recent bottling of garnacha from Spain.

      ----PATTI  VDRJ67A----

1). Prepare the meat by triming the border of fat to a thickness of
1/4". Slash fat at 1" intervals to prevent curling during cooking.
2). If desired, marinate the meat for one hour or more to tenderize
and flavor it. Flavor increases with longer marinating. 3). Season
the meat with pepper, garlic or herbs before placing it on the grill.
Add salt after grilling because it will draw juices from meat during
grilling. 4). Place steak on gas grill over medium heat or on
charcoal grill over medium-high coals. Cook to desired doneness,
using cooking times listed below. For a juicier steak, turn meat only
once and do not pierce with a fork.

Jeff's Chicken Fried Steak

none

1/2 lb round steak
1 cup flour
1 cup milk
1  egg
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 oil for cooking
      ----CREAM GRAVY----
1 cup milk
1 cup water
1/4 cup flour
1  salt
1  pepper

Heat 1/4 inch oil in heavy frying pan to medium high.

Combine 1 cup milk with the egg, whisk to mix.  Pour into 9" round
shallow pan.

Season 1 cup flour with the garlic powder, salt and pepper. Sift together
into 9" round shallow pan.

Tenderize the round steak well, trimming off excess fat and ligament.

Dip the meat into the egg and milk mixture, then dredge in the seasoned
flour, pressing the flour into the meat.  Repeat for a crispier coating.

When oil is hot, place the meat into oil, adjusting temp. to allow the
meat to cook for 9-12 minutes.  This allows additional tenderizing of the
meat.

When fried steak is golden brown, remove to drain on paper towels.

CREAM GRAVY:

Pour off all but 4 tablespoons of the cooking oil from the pan. Over
medium heat, slowly stir in the 1/4 cup flour, stirring constantly.

Combine the 1 cup milk and 1 cup water, slowly add to oil/flour mix,
stirring constantly.  Stirring with a large spatula helps.  Loosen brown
bits from bottom of pan while stirring, there's great flavor there.

Add salt and pepper to taste, raising heat to bring to a boil.  When
bubbly, lower heat and continue to stir, simmering for 5 minutes.

It's traditional to serve the meat with mashed potatoes, covering the
meat and potatoes with the gravy.  Large yeast rolls go great with this
meal too.

Well worth the effort!

Enjoy!   Jeff Duke

Joyce's Steak & Mushroom Gravy

meats, improv

1  good round steak, trimmed & cut int; o serving portions
1  flour
1  salt and pepper
1  cream of mushroom soup
1  cooking oil or shortening

Salt and pepper each side of the steak pieces. Roll thoroughly in
flour, coating each side heavily. Fry in hot oil until each side is
browned (steak doesn't have to be done...just brown). As each piece
is browned, remove from the skillet and set aside. While the steak is
frying, open the mushroom soup...at least 2 cans..and put the soup in
a bowl. Stir it up to smooth it...then gradually add equal amounts of
water, keeping the mixture smooth. Transfer the steak into a large
pot. Pour the mushroom soup mixture in with the steak. Bring to a
boil, then cover and simmer for at least 1-2 hours or longer. You
should be able to cut the steak with a fork, so the thicker the
pieces, the longer you cook it. You may also add some milk and/or
water, but not too much. The soup becomes the gravy, so let it boil
own to gravy consistency. You can also put this in the oven to cook.

Suggestions: Serve with buttery mashed potatoes, fresh green beans,
and a salad.

NOTE: Even people who ordinarily do not like mushrooms like this!
In fact, if you don't tell them about the mushrooms, chances
are they won't even know it....

Kathy Pitt's Chicken Fried Steak

none

1  no ingredients

Begin with a good-sized hunk of round steak, the steak should be at least
1/2 inch thick.  Cut the steak into serving-sized pieces.

Now the fun begins.  I use a method of tenderizing the meat passed on to me
by my father, who made great CFS -- first, score the exterior of the meat
with tiny, diamond-shaped patterns (like you'd use to score the fat on a
ham, but make the diamonds only about 1/4 inch long.) Do this to both sides
of the meat.  Then pound the heck out of the meat using the heaviest
implement you can find (a heavy saucer, the handle of a BIG knife or -- my
personal favorite -- a clean claw hammer).

The meat should be pounded until it almost, but not quite, gives up and
falls to pieces.

Now mix up a quantity of seasoned flour (salt, pepper, maybe some paprika
and garlic powder).  Also beat a couple of whole eggs with a couple of
tablespoons of water.

Dip the pounded meat first in the flour, then in the egg, then back in the
flour.  For a really crisp crust, dip again in the egg, and back in the
flour (this is optional, but I almost always do it, to me, the crust is the
best part of the dish).  Allow the breaded meat to sit for a few minutes to
set up the breading.

Melt some oil, bacon grease or lard in a heavy frying pan. Use enough to
cover the pan to the depth of 1/4 inch.  When the fat is hot, but not
smoking, place some of the meat in the pan.  Do not overcrowd, and do not
allow the individual pieces of steak to touch.

Cook on one side until nicely browned, turn and cook the second side.
Remove the cooked steak to a warm place, and continue cooking the remainder
until all is done.  Add more fat to the pan as needed.

Add 2 Tbsp. of flour to every 2 Tbsp. of fat left in the pan (stir to
scrape up the little browned, crispy bits that are sticking to the pan,
too).  Cook this mixture briefly to get rid of the raw flour taste, but do
not allow it to brown.  Stir in milk (about 1 cup to each 2 Tbsp. of flour)
to make a gravy.  Season to taste with salt, black pepper (lots of black
pepper), and serve gravy of the meat and the mashed potatoes you're going
to serve on the side.

1 1/2 lb flank steak (1 piece)
1/2 medium sweet onion; thinly sliced
1  and separated into rings
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 large clove garlic; split
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon soy sauce

Pull off any membrane from the steak and trim away any surface fat.
Score the steak, 1/8-inch deep, on both sides in a diamond pattern.
In a plastic bag or glass dish large enough to hold the steak,
combine the onion, lemon juice, garlic, sugar, salt, and soy sauce.
Add the steak and close the bag tightly if using and turn the meat to
coat thoroughly. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature, 6 to
8 hours in the refrigerator. Drain off and reserve the marinade.
Grill the steak 3 to 5 inches above hot coals until rare to
medium-rare, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, heat the
remaining marinade.  Remove the steak to a cutting board and cut, in
thin slices, across the grain, slanting the knife slightly. Serve the
meat with the marinade.

2 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon butter (or margarine)
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 centiliter garlic, minced (or more)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
4 teaspoon lemon juice
2 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
1 dash tobasco (optional)
1/4 cup chopped parsley

Trim fat from steaks;pat dry with towel. Slash edges to prevent curling
(if steaks are thin). In large skillet, combine oil, butter, mustard,
garlic, salt & pepper. Heat until bubbly. Saute steaks for 4-5 min. Turn
and cook until done the way you like 'em. Remove steaks; keep warm. Into
saucepan, stir lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce & Tobasco if used. Pour
over steaks; sprinkle with parsley.

I think adding the lemon juice & Worcestershire directly to the  skillet
and combining with the drippings makes a yummier sauce.

Marinade For Steak

none

1 cup olive oil
1  or:
1  or:
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1 coarsely ground pepper
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup sherry vinegar
1/2 cup wine; red or white
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 garlic cloves; sliced
2 tablespoon freshly chopped herbs
1 red peppercorns; if desired
1 teaspoon sugar

"... Ingredients in a marinade can be varied, but it is important to
use wine, vinegar, lemon juice, or some acidic liquid to break down
the connective tissues.  This process will make the steak more tender.
Remaining marinade ingredients add flavor." Use a good-quality olive
oil or walnut oil; add good-quality wine or vinegar and a combination
of fresh and dried herbs, seasonings, garlic and soy sauce to make a
flavorful marinade. 1.  Place all ingredients in glass screw-top jar;
shake vigorously. Arrange meat in shallow glass dish; pierce with a
fork. Pour marinade over meat; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate
several hours or overnight, turning meat occasionally. 2.  Remove
meat from marinade; pat dry. Remove any pieces of spices or herbs
that may stick to meat. This recipe is a steak marinade, but the
ingredients can be adapted for other meats using the same techniques.

Marinated Flank Steak W/Lemon Herb Butter

main dish, meats

1  flank steak, 1 to 1 1/2lbs
1/4 cup ea. salad oil & dry red wine
1 tablespoon worcestershire
2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1  clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon summer savory leaves
      ----FOR GARNISH----
1  watercress sprigs

Lemon herb butter:  Beat 1/3 cup soft butter until fluffy; gradually
beat in 1 1/2 T lemon juice until well combined. Mix in 3 T each
finely chopped parsley and watercress, 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce,
1/4 tsp. tarragon and dash white pepper.  Shape into a roll or cube,
wrap, and chill to blend flavors. Place steak in shallow dish. In a
covered jar or blender, shake together oil, wine, worcestershire
sauce, soy sauce, mustard, garlic, salt, sugar, and savory. Pour over
steak, turning to coat well. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hrs. or more,
turning once or twice. Remove steak, reserving marinade.  Place on a
rack in a broiling pan. Broil about 4" from heat, until well browned
(about 6 minutes per side for rare), brushing occasionally with
marinade.  Slice thinly, cutting diagonally. Serve topped with thin
slices of lemon herb butter. Garnish with watercress. TIPS: Flank
steak will be most tender if cooked only to rare or medium rare stage
of doneness.  Cooked more, it tends to become rather tough. You can
substitute 2 T cider vinegar for 1/4 cup dry red wine.

2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 each pinch sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon dry sherry

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++ Preparation:  Cut tops of green onions into 2" long pieces.
Combine sauce ingredients in small bowl & stir thoroughly.  Cut steak
across the grain into thin slices, about 1/2" deep by 2" long.  In
bowl big enough to hold meat, combine egg whites, salt & water
chestnut flour.  Beat with chopstick until frothy.  Add steak, & use
fingers to coat each slice. Deep-frying:  In wok, heat oil to
moderately hot.  When ready, piece of coated meat will rise to
surface immediately.  Fry meat in small batches; drop in 1 slice at a
time to avoid sticking.  Cook until lightly brown, about 1 minute.
Drain on Chinese strainer or paper bag. Stir-frying:  Remove all but
2 T of oil from wok.  With wok at medium heat, quickly stir-fry green
onions & ginger for about 20 seconds.  Add sauce; bring to boil on
high heat while stirring.  Add beef all at once, & toss with sauce
until beef is hot & coated.  Push beef out of sauce, dribble in
cornstarch paste to lightly thicken.  Recombine.  Serve immediately.

Mrs. Beeton's Steak & Kidney Pie

main dish, meats, pies

1 each flaky pastry
      ----FILLING----
600 gm chuck/blade steak
3 each 15 ml spoons plain flour
1 each 5 ml spoon salt
1/2 each 2.5 ml spoon ground pepper
2 each medium onions
250 ml beef stock
2 each sheep or 150g ox kidneys
      ----GLAZE----
1 each beaten egg (or)
1  milk

Wipe the steak and trim off any excess fat.  Cut the steak into
1-2 cm cubes.  Mix the flour, salt, & pepper in a bag or deep bowl.
Toss the cubes of meat in the seasoned flour and put them in a 1
litre pie dish. Skin and chop the onions and sprinkle between the
meat. Skin, core, and cut the kidneys before mixing with the steak
and onions. Pour in the stock to quarter fill the dish.
Roll out the pastry and use to cover the dish. Trim the edge and
flute.  Make a small hole in the centre of the lid and decorate with
leaves of pastry. Make a pastry rose or tassel to cover the hole
after baking.
Bake the pie in a very hot oven (230C/450F) until the pastry is
risen and brown.  Bake the tassel or rose blind. Reduce the oven to
moderate (180C/350F) and, if necessary, place the pie on a lower
shelf. Cover with greaseproof paper to prevent the pastry from
overbrowning and continue cooking for about 2 hours until the meat is
quite tender when tested with a skewer.  Heat the remaining stock and
pour in enough to fill the dish by funnelling it through the hole in
the pastry. Insert the tassel, or rose and serve.

2 tablespoon instant minced onion 2 tablespoon water 4 tablespoon
vegetable oil divided 1 lb fresh mushrooms chopped 1 1/4 teaspoon
salt divided 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs 1 beaten egg 1 teaspoon coarse

through the center of the meat to within 1 inch of the sides. Combine
onion with water; set aside for 10 minutes to soften. In a large
skillet heat 2 tablespoon of the oil. Add onion; saute until golden,
about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and 3/4 teaspoon of the salt; saute
until all of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Add bread
crumbs and egg; mix well and cool. Spoon mushroom mixture into
pockets of steak with remaining 2 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle steak on
both sides with black pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook

Peppered Round Steak

meats, sauces

1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/2 lb top round steak; cut 1 1/2
1  inches thick (up to 2 lb
1  can be used)
2 tablespoon balsamic or red wine vinegar
1  freshly ground black pepper
      ----SHALLOT CREAM----
2 tablespoon marinade for peppered round
1  steak
1 tablespoon shallots; minced
1 cup heavy (whipping) cream
1  salt and coarsely ground
1  black pepper

Heat the oil until very warm but not sizzling.  Place the meat in a
shallow dish and pierce all over with a fork. Turn and pierce the
other side. Pour half the warm oil on the meat and poke with a fork
so that the oil penetrates the meat fibers.  Turn and repeat the
process on the other side. Pour the vinegar over the steak and turn.
Cover and marinate, at room temperature, about 2 hours or overnight
in the refrigerator, piercing and turning the meat occasionally.
Remove the meat, reserve the marinade, and sprinkle the pepper over
the meat generously, pressing it in with the heel of your hand. Grill
the meat 3-inches above the hot coals until browned then turn and
grill the other side. Move to the edge of the grill and continue
cooking until done as desired. This steak is the tenderest if grilled
to rare, about 18 minutes to total cooking time or medium-rare, about
22 minutes. Place on a warm platter and slice across the grain. Serve
with the Shallot Cream, if desired.

SHALLOT CREAM:

In a small skillet, heat the marinade.  Stir in the shallots and cook
until lightly browned.  Stir in the cream and cook, stirring often,
until slightly reduced. Season to taste with the salt and pepper.
Serve with the steak.

Peppered Steak

meats

4  sirloin steaks, excess fat removed
2 tablespoon heaped, black peppercorns
4 oz butter
6  galric cloves, peeled and chopped f; inely
6  slices of ginger, finely shredded
2 tablespoon oyster sauce
2 teaspoon soy sauce

Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 6/400F/200C. Roughly pound the
peppercorns and fry, without oil, over a moderate heat for one minute
or until you sneeze. This should take about two minutes, but remove
them as soon as you get a strong spicy fragrance. In a frying pan
heat the butter over a moderate heat and when it has melted add the
garlic and ginger and colour gently for two minutes. Add the steaks
and lightly brown on both sides. Transfer to the oven and roast for
five minutes, remove and keep warm. If you like your meat well done,
leave in the oven for another 3 or 4 minutes.

Add the crushed peppercorns, two tablespoons of oyster sauce and one
dessertspoon of soy sauce to the butter and cook over a moderate heat,
taking care not to burn the butter. Serve the steaks with the butter
and pepper poured over and some broccoli and new potatoes.

Porterhouse Steak In A Skillet

beef, information

1  porterhouse steak 1 to 1 1/2  thick
1/4 cup olive oil
1  black pepper
2 tablespoon butter
1  juice of 1/2 lemon

1. A good thick (1 to 1 1/2 inch) porterhouse easily will feed two to
four people, unless they are starving lumberjacks or threshers. So
buy one steak for every two (or four) people, the day before you plan
to cook it. It benefits by spending a day in a good olive-oil bath.

2. Pour 1/4 cup of the best quality olive oil over eack steak, along
with a generous grind of coarse black pepper. Let the steak marinate,
refrigerated, for 8 to 12 hours, turningoccasionally. If the steak is
frozen, it may take as long as 24 hours to thaw, and the best way to
do it is in an oil bath.

3. When you are ready for the best steak that you've ever eaten, heat
that black iron skillet over high heat until it's almost red hot. I
use an old Wagner skillet that's 11 inches across with the ridges on
the bottom that give those great grill marks to the steak. (Somehow
those grill marks make any steak taste better). Two big porterhouse
steaks will fit in my skillet at the same time. If I need to cook
more than two, I use the broiler in my oven or my barbecue grill.

4. Put the steak in the hot skillet and stand back! It's going to
sizzle some, and smoke a little - it could even set off your smoke
alarm. Cook the steak for about 2 minutes, then turn it 90 degrees
and cook another 2 minutes. Turn the steak and repeat the process for
the second side. The total cooking time is about 8 to 10 minutes.

5. If a steak is to be cooked past the rare stage, turn the heat down
after the second position so that the outside won't char before the
inside is cooked to the desired degree ofdoneness. When the steak is
well seared, with a nice crust on one side, turn it and sear the
other. Reduce the heat to medium and cook to the desired degree of
doneness. An instant-read thermometer is a must for cooking all kinds
of meat.

6. Remove the cooked steak to a heated serving platter. Remove the
pan from the heat to cool slightly, then return to low heat and add 2
tablespoons butter and the juice of half a lemon to make a simple
lemon-butter sauce that adds a nice zip to the flavor of the steak.

7. If you are using a black iron skillet with the ridges on the
bottom, stirring with a basting brush will help mix the lemon butter
and, at the same time, incorporate the steak drippings that have
drained down between the ridges of the skillet. Pour the sauce over
the steak, garnish with a sprig of chopped parsley and serve
immediately. A good steak doesn't like to be kept waiting.

Porterhouse Steak With Red Wine Sauce

meats, beef, sauces

3 lb porterhouse steak
1  about 2 1/2-in. thick
1  salt and pepper
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon shallots, chopped
1/2 cup burgundy or cabernet
1/2 cup brown sauce or
1  canned brown beef gravy

1. Select a very heavy skillet for this. A heavy, traditional black
iron skillet is excellent. Sprinkle the steak on both sides with salt
and pepper. Use a fairly generous amount of black pepper. Pat with
the fingers to make the seasoning adhere. 2. Heat the oil in the
skillet and when quite hot, add the steak. The primary goal is to
sear the steak well on both sides over moderately high heat. Cook the
steak on the first side about 5-7 min. until it is quite dark without
burning. Turn the steak and cook about 10 min. on the other side,
until quite dark but not burnt. 3. Reduce the heat slightly and turn
the steak again. Cook about 10 min., then turn the steak again.
Continue cooking, turning as necessary. The total cooking time
recommended is about 45 min, from start to finish. 4. Remove the
steak from the skillet and cover loosely with foil. Let rest so that
the internal juices are redistributed. 5. Meanwhile, pour off the fat
from the skillet. Wipe lightly with paper towels. Add 1 tbsp of
butter to the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned particles that
cling to the bottom. Add the shallots and cook briefly. 6. Add the
wine and boil to reduce about 30 sec. Stir in the brown gravy and
reduce to 2/3. Remove from the heat and swirl in the remaining
butter. 7. To serve, spoon a little of the sauce onto each of 4 hot
plates. Slice the steak and place the slices on the sauce.

Roast Flank Steak With Potatoes Amd Portobell

meats, beef, miamiherald

4 medium baking potatoes
12 centiliter garlic; smashed, peeled and rough
1 cup olive oil
2 teaspoon kosher salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
4  portobello mushrooms, stem ends tri; mmed and caps wiped clean
2 lb flank steak; trimmed of all surface fa

Place one oven rack on lowest level and one rack on the next level
above. Heat oven to 500 degrees F. Forty minutes before roasting the
steak and mushrooms, use a fork to prick the potatoes once or twice
each. Place them directly on the sides of the upper rack of the oven,
allowing enough room for the mushrooms, which will cook on the same
rack. Put the garlic in the blender or food processor with 4
tablespoons of the oil. Blend until smooth.  Scrape down the sides
with a rubber spatula. Add remaining oil and salt and pepper. Blend
until smooth. Put the mushrooms in a 12-by-8-by-1 1/2-inch roasting
pan. Using the spatula, scrape out half the garlic mixture into the
pan. Rub the puree into both sides of each mushrooms cap. Allow to
marinate for at least 30 minutes. Put steak in shallow container
large enough to hold it. Pour remaining garlic mixture over and rub
into both sides of steak. Let marinate on kitchen counter at least 30
minutes or until meat comes to room temperature. Before roasting the
steak and mushrooms, put a 14-by-12-by-2-inch roasting pan on the
lower oven rack and preheat for 10 minutes. Remove pan. Immediately,
put the steak with all of its marinade in the pan. Place on the lower
rack, the thickest part of the steak to the rear of the oven. Place
the mushrooms on the upper rack at the same time. For rare, roast the
steak on one side for 6 minutes(for medium, 8 minutes). Turn the
steak and ,ushrooms. Roast 6 minutes more. Remove steak, mushrooms
and potatoes from the oven. Let steak rest about 5 minutes,  Slice
thinly against the grain.

to what the rest of the world knows as braising--the ingredients are
briefly browned or sauteed, then cooked with a little liquid over a
low heat for a long time." Season the roast with one half of the salt
and peppers. Dust with flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch
oven or other large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak,
and brown well on all sides. Remove the meat and pour off all but 1
teaspoon of the oil. Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and
the other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point. Return the roast to
the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables. Cover and let cook
until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve the
meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over all. When you
try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to adjust the
cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide. For extra
flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic before
smothering. Serves 4-6 From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking" Random

Spanish Fried Steak-Mom's

main dish, beef, ethnic

4 cup water
16 tablespoon catsup
16 tablespoon onion
1  cl garlic, minced
16 tablespoon celery, sliced, or tops
1  salt and pepper
1/2 cup flour
1  lard or shortening

I don't know why Mom called it Spanish-probably the tomato. I like it
best thick, and with mashed, or baked potato it was so good. Enjoy.
Add shortening to large pan. Saute minced garlic. Dip pieces of meat
in flour, salt and pepper mixture. Fry in hot fat. Drop in kettle of
water (4 cups) and add remaining ingredients. When meat is done,
about 4 hours on low heat, it can be thickened with flour and water.
Adapts to Crockpot cooking.

Special Steaks (Venison Or Beef)

beef

6  boneless venison chops --
1  all fat cut off
1 cup white wine
1 can cream of mushroom soup,
1  condensed
1 small onion -- sliced thinly
1  spoon of vegetable oil

Brown the venison chops in the oil on the stove.  This is just to
give them color, not to cook them so don't cook too long. Put the
venison in a casserole along with the onion slices. Pour the white
wine on top. It should just barely cover the meat, so add more if you
need. Bake for one hour at 175C (350F). After one hour, mix in the
can of cream of mushroom soup.  Do not add any water. The soup will
probably not mix well, don't worry about it as it will "melt" while
cooking. Bake another hour at 175C (350F).  Very good with wild rice.

main dish, meats, beef

8 oz boneless steak, trimmed
4 each green onions
1 each medium onion
4 each garlic cloves
1 teaspoon salt
6 oz somen
1 tablespoon asian sesame oil
6 tablespoon vegetable oil, divided use
2 each serrano chilies, halved
2 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 each juice of 2 limes
1/2 cup beef broth
1 cup whole fresh mint leaves

Note: Somen is thin white wheat noodles. Cook's notes: Use caution
when working with fresh chilies. Upon completion of slicing, wash
work surface and hands thoroughly; do not touch your eyes. Most
supermarkets stock oyster sauce in their Asian specialty sections.
Procedure: Cut the steak into 3-inch-by-1/4-inch strips. Cut
dark-green part of the onions into 3-inch pieces and finely chop the
remainder. Thinly slice the onion. Mince the garlic. Bring 4 quarts
water and the salt to boil. Add the noodles and cook uncovered over
high heat, stirring with chopsticks or a fork, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes
or until the noodles are just tender. Refresh under cold water and
drain. Transfer the noodles to a colander in a large bowl. Toss with
sesame oil. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large
skillet over medium- high heat. Add sliced onion and chilies and
stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until onion is lightly browned.
Transfer to a bowl and reserve. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the wok and
increase the heat to high. Stirfry the steak for 1 to 2 minutes, or
until it just changes color. Transfer the steak to the bowl and
reserve. Lower the heat to medium and add the remaining oil to the
wok. Add garlic and green onions and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the
noodles to the pan and heat thoroughly. Add the broth, soy sauce and
oyster sauce and heat thoroughly. Add steak, onion slices, chilies,
mint leaves and lime; stir-fry for 30 seconds. Presentation: Serve
the spicy somen on heated plates. The chilies can be removed or left
in for garnish. Warn your guests: They are extremely hot. Yield:

Steak & Kidney Pudding

beef

1  kidney, beef
4 tablespoon shortening
2  onion; chopped
2 lb round steak; cubed
1 1/2 tablespoon worcester sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoon butter; softened
2 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoon parsley; minced
1 teaspoon rosemary
1 teaspoon organo
      ----PASTRY----
1 cup flour; + 2 t
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup shortening
2 tablespoon ; water, cold

Calories     per serving: 654 Fat grams per serving:
36    Approx. Cook Time: 2:30

Wash the kidney, remove membranes and fat, and cut kidney in 1"
cubes. Cube the steak into 1" cubes. Melt the shortening in a heavy
pot. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until well browned. Add
the steak and kidneys. When the meat is browned on all sides, pour on
2 cups of boiling water, Worcester, salt, and pepper. Cove and cook
over a very low heat for 1 1/2 hours, or until the steak is tender.
Preheat the oven to 400 F. Blend the butter with the flour to make a
beurre manie. Drop small pellets of this paste into the sauce and
stir to thicken it. Put meat and sauce into a deep pie plate and
sprinkle with parsley. If you wish to use a pastry topping, roll out
the dough and cover the pie plate. Slash the top, crimp the edges,
and bake about 30 minutes, or until well browned.

Pastry:  Mix the flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with a pastry
blender.  Combine lightly only until the mixture resembles coarse
meal or very tine peas; its texture will not be uniform but will
contain crumbs and small bits and pieces.  Sprinkle water over the
flour mixture, a tablespoon at a time, and mix lightly with a fork,
using only enough water so that the pastry will hold together when
pressed gently into a ball.

Steak & Kidney Sponge

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
3 tablespoon flour
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  floured steak
1  floured kidney
1  onion, diced
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon dry sherry
1  beef stock
1 tablespoon butter
2  eggs
50 ml milk
200 gm self-raising flour

This is the no-fuss version great-grandma probably made on washing
day when she hadn't the time to fiddle with pastry or pudding-making.
Though the dish spends a long time in the oven looking after itself,
it takes no time at all to make.

Put three tablespoons of plain flour seasoned with salt and pepper in
a plastic bag and shake to coat with flour. Transfer the floured
steak and kidney to a large casserole with a lid and mix in one
onion, diced. Over the top pour 1 tablespoon Worces- tershire sauce,
2 tablespoons dry sherry and sufficient beef stock to reach the top
of the meat. Cover the casserole and bake in a slow oven (140 degrees
C) for
3    hours.

Cream 1 tablespoon softened butter or margarine, add 2 eggs and 50 mL
milk and dredge in 220 g self-raising flour. Mix to a soft dough,
turn out onto a floury surface and with floury hands pat out to the
same dimensions as the interior of the casserole. Place the sponge
dough on top of the steak and kidney, press well around the sides of
the casserole and cook for a further half hour with the lid on. Cut
the sponge into wedges and serve on top of generous amounts of steak
and kidney.

beef, seafood

1 lb boneless beef round steak

vegetarians, use eggplant slices instead of meat, and use vegetable
broth.

thick, 1" wide, and 3" long. Peel and slice onions; wipe mushrooms
clean with damp paper towel and slice lengthwise. Seed peppers and
cut into strips; trim the zucchini and cut into 3" sticks. Heat oil
in wok or large skillet [MW: browning dish]; stir toss meat strips to
brown on both sides (1 or 2 minutes). Push to side of pan; add onions
and mushrooms; stir each to glaze. Add pepper strips, zucchini; cook
about 3 minutes, tossing occasionally. Add worcestershire sauce which
has been stirred with cornstarch; then add catsup, crushed red pepper
(if desired) and beef broth. Bring to a boil; add shrimp. Cover and
cook until shrimp are pink and hot through (1 to 4 minutes). Stir

Steak Salad Marinated In Orange Juice & Hot Chile Sesame

none

1 cup orange juice; fresh squeezed
3/4 cup vegetable oil (divided use)
4 tablespoon red wine vinegar (divided)
1 dash hot chile sesame oil
1  .  several
1 salt & pepper to taste
1 red bell pepper; julienned
2 lb strip sirloin, flank steak
8 portobello mushrooms; stem
1  .  removed
16 new potatoes; washed
1 bunch scallions; green & white
1  . parts w/ root end cut off
4 large handfuls mixed greens
1  . any kind
1  cilantro

1. For the salad dressing: Put 2 tablespoons of orange juice in a bowl big
enough to hold the peppers and a vinaigrette. Add 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2
tablespoons of the red wine vinegar, 2 or 3 dashes hot chile sesame oil,
salt and pepper to taste. Then whisk and correct seasonings. Put peppers
into the vinaigrette and leave them there.

2. For the marinade: Take half the remaining orange juice, add to it (this
recipe is not very precise because it doesn't have to be) 2 tablespoons
vegetab}e oil, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, a couple dashes hot chile
sesame oil and salt and pepper to taste. Add meat. A good way to marinate
the meat is in a tightly closed plastic bag, turning often. The meat should
marinate for half an hour to an hour, no longer.

3. Now using the rest of the orange juice, make the same marinade as above,
and brush the mushrooms with it, rebrushing as often as you can for about
half an hour.

4. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, drop in the potatoes, and cook
them for 15 minutes or so, until a knife pierces them easily. Drain and cut
them in half, so they'll be able to react to the dressing. Keep them
slightly warm, if you can. (If not, don't worry about it.)

5. Broil or grill the mushrooms first (a grill is great for this), then the
scallions. Cut the scallions in half after they're grilled. Keep these
vegetables slightly warm, if you can, or don't, if you can't. Now grill the
steak, to the desired degree of doneness, let it rest a few minutes, then
slice on the diagonal.

6. To compose the salad, put the greens onto a big platter first, then add
potatoes and toss well with dressing and peppers, whisking the dressing
first to make sure it's still well incorporated. Now put the scallions on,
in a crisscross pattern, then lay the mushrooms on top. Make a well in the
center of the platter, then layer the steak prettily. Snip the cilantro, if
you're using it, sprinkle on top, and serve right away, passing the hot
bread.

substituted brandy and found it quite good. I also used sirloin
instead of the fillets.

Steamed Puddings - Steak & Kidney Filling

main dish, beef, british

      ----FILLING----
2 cup round steak, diced
1 cup beef kidney, cooked\diced
1  salt to taste
1  ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon dark soya sauce
      ----PASTRY----
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup ground suet
1 teaspoon white pepper

1. Saute kidney, after trimming off membrane and fat, in frying pan
lubricrated with a little oil and butter. When cooked, allow to sit
to cool out of the pan. Reserve the pan and juices. Dice the round
steak [other steak cuts may be used, including stew beef]. Steak
should be diced to desired cube size. Dice the kidney slightly finer
than the beef [smaller bits and pieces are preferrable]. Add the beef
and the filling spices to the skillet. Cook thoroughly.

2. Discard oils that have been extracted during the cooking process.
Allow meat to become cold. Using warm or hot meat will adversely
effect the pastry shell.

3. Thoroughly mix all-purpose flour with suet. Do not use a
substitute for the suet - the results will not be acceptable. If the
suet is an extremely fine grind (powdery) use slightly less. The
consistency should be similar to that used in making Mince-meat. A
food processor may be utilized in making the dough.

4. Add cold water to the mixture, a little at a time. Continue to
blend together. A pea-sized consistency will be achieved then dough
will form into a ball. Allow to stand for 5-10 mins.

5. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry ball to obtain a sheet
approx 1/4" thick. Make (or find) a circular template that will gauge
the proper amount of pastry to fit into your pudding form.

Note: pudding forms come in a variety of sizes. Anything that will
stand up to being steamed, is approximately the size and shape of a
coffee mug, and has a lid, would be appropriate. Heat-resistent
plastic steaming cups with snap on covers are best.

6. Use the template to cut 4 pastry shells from the sheet. Gently
press these shells into the steaming cups so as to cover the bottom
and sides. Pleat where necessary to follow curve of the cup and allow
pastry to hang over the sides at the top.

6. Place approx 1/4 of the meat filling into each cup. Press the meat
down slightly in each cup so as to fill to within 1/4 in. of the top.
A Tablespoon of a brown gravy may be added to each cup if the meat is
particularly dry.

7. Re-work remaining pastry. Cut circles of dough slightly smaller
than the diameter of the snap on lid. This forms the cap of the
pastry shell. Joined to the pastry shell to the cap by pressed the
pastry together around the circumference and folding in the hanging
edges. A slightly thick cap is desired - although great excess should
be trimmed away. Snap on the lid, and place each steamed pudding into
the steaming device that you intend to use.

8. Steam for 25-30 minutes. Check at 20 min. to determine degree of
progress. The pastry should take on a slightly shiney look and be
firm to the touch when done. Puddings will stand up to overcooking.

9. Serve with a rich beef gravy, chips (french-fries), and peas.
Reconstituted dried green peas is the traditional vegetable.

Footnote: This recipe orginally contained diced beef and kidney as
the meat filling. Since few people seem to appreciate the kidney
ingredient, and considering that minced beef (hamburger meat) is an
economical alternative, this recipe may be modified accordingly.

The Steak and Kidney Pudding is a widely recognized British dish.

Tabasco Classic - Perfect Seared Steaks

none

4 new york strip or:
1 rib eye steaks, 2 thick
2 2/3 teaspoon tabasco pepper sauce
1 freshly cracked black pepper
1  salt

This is our favorite way to cook steaks outdoors on a charcoal grill, and
it works well with hamburgers, too.  Start with a good "steak fire" of
white coals 3 to 4 inches below the grill.  To test the fire, put the palm
of your hand just above the grill.  If you can keep it there only for as
long as it takes to say "One thousand and one," the fire is ready.

Place the steaks on a cutting board and, with the back of a spoon, briskly
rub about 1/3 teaspoon Tabasco sauce and some pepper into both sides of
each steak.  Grill the steaks over a hot fire for about 5 minutes on each
side for medium-rare.

To broil, preheat the broiler, place the seasoned steaks on an oiled
broiler rack, and cook 6 inches from the heat for 4 to 5 minutes on each
side for medium-rare.  Add salt to taste.

dredging pracitcal.) Place oil in a heavy frying pan and heat to frying
temperature over moderate heat. Add meat and brown on both sides. Transfer
steaks to a 1 1/2 quart casserole. Fry peppers and onions over moderate
heat in the pan in which the meat was browned, stirring frequently. Remove
vegetables with a slotted spoon and spread over meat. Pour out any
remaining fat. Add beef broth to frying pan and cook and stir over moderate
heat to absorb and brown particles remaining in the pan. Add remaining
ingredients to broth. Mix well and pour over meat. Stir the meat and
vegetables lightly with a fork to distribute the broth and vegetables.
Cover tightly and bake at 325 degrees for about 1-1 1/2 hours or until the
meat is tender.  Serve 1 piece of steak with some of the sauce per serving.

Tex-Mex Steak & Tortillas

meats, mexican, vegetables, beef

1  1/2-in. thick
1/2 cup corn oil
3 teaspoon garlic, chopped
4 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 lb ripe tomatoes
1/2 cup onion, chopped fine
1/4 cup red chilies, chopped fine
1/4 cup coriander, chopped fine
12  flour tortillas

well. Set this sauce aside. 4. Put about 4 slices of steak at a time
on the hot grill and cook for 1 min. or less to a side, depending on
the desired degree of doneness. Simultaneously, add a similar number
of tortillas and cook them for a few sec. to a side just to heat
through. Do not heat for for long or they will dry out. 5. Place one
piece of steak in the center of a warm tortilla, spoon a little sauce
over the meat and fold the side of the tortilla over the ends up to
enclose the meat. Eat like a sandwich.

The Best Chicken-Fried Steak South Of Omaha

meats, tex mex

1  6 ounce round steak cutlet
1  machine tenderized
1  flour
4  eggs
1 can flat beer
1 tablespoon adolph's meat tenderizer
1  salt, pepper, and garlic
1  salt -- to taste

Bill Maxwell, former Texas restaurateur, originally claimed his
chicken-fried steak was the "best found south of the Rio Brazos."
Subsequent chicken-fried steak contests proved him truthful, so he
extended his claim to include all lands south of the Arkansas River.
In another conversation with Bill, we found his "boundary" had crept
north to Omaha, Nebraska. Well, eventually he's gonna have to stop at
the North Pole ... we hope.

Sprinkle salt, pepper and garlic salt on both sides of tenderized
steak to taste. Put steak onto a tray that is well-covered with
flour. Then "pound the hell out of it (the steak) with stiff fingers,
working from the center out, until it reaches the size of an L.P.
record." (That's those things they used to make before compact
discs). Flip several times and repeat pounding. Mix eggs, beer, 1
teaspoon salt and Adolph's meat tenderizer in a shallow bowl. Add
enough flour to make a thin, watery batter. Beat mixture smooth. Dip
meat into batter. "Flop" back onto flour tray and cover with four.
Pound again with fingertips until moisture is absorbed. Cook in deep
fat at 350 degrees until golden brown. Serve with French fries and
cover with white gravy.

Venison Steaks With Mushroom Game Sauce

meats

4  venison steaks cut from loin
1  juniper berries; ground
2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter; melted
      Wild mushroom game sauce ----sauce-
1 oz dried boletus edulis (cepe,
2 cup water
2 oz fresh onions; chopped
3 tablespoon butter; melted
3 tablespoon flour
1 cup rich meat stock; * see note
1/2 cup dry red wine
1  salt and pepper; to taste
6  juniper berries; crushed fin
2  allspice berries; crushed fi
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 oz dill pickles; diced

Recipe by: plgold@ix.netcom.com (Pat Gold) * preferably from the game
being used, commercial ok

Notes: Prepare wild mushroom game sauce.

STEAKS:

Do not overcook the venison here.  It should be done no more than
medium rare in the center.  This perparation does not require
marinading, because the tenderness of the loin meat. Serve with
quick-sauteed potatoes with dill sauce, and Stag's Leap Cabernet.

1.  Pound the steaks to 1/2-inch thickness.  Sprinle lightly with the
juniper berries and salt.

2.  Saute the steaks with the butter for about 3 minutes on each
side. The meat should be done no more than medium rare.

3.  Heat the wild mushroom game sauce, adjust for salt, pour over the
steks, and serve.

SAUCE:

This sauce is excellent for furred game, especially if the meat has
not been marinated.  It is very much in the traditional European
Hunter's Style, which uses juinper berries and pickles. It was
developed through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by cooks
working on the great landed-gentry estates of France, Poland and
Germany.

1.  Clean mushrooms thoroughly under brisk running water.

2.  Combine the mushrooms and about 2 cups of water in a saucepan, and
bring to a boil.  Then reduce the heat, and let simmer for 30 minutes.
Remove reconstituted mushrooms from broth, and set aside for later
addition to sauce.

3.  Prepare a roux:  Saute the onions in the butter until they are
almost traansparent; add the flour, and stir for 1 minute.

4.  Add the simmered mushroom extract, strained meat stock, and red
wine to the roux mixture, and stir till blended and slightly
thickened. Season with salt and pepper.

5.  Add juniper berries, allspice, mustard, paprika, reconstituted
mushrooms, and dill pickles.  Simmer for 5 minutes. Add salt and
pepper. The sauce is now ready to use.
